Shirt Fusion360

This project uses ThreeJS and React Three Fiber for 3D graphics, TailwindCSS for styling, and Framer Motion for animations. Explore loading and customizing 3D models, camera manipulation, and object positioning.

With code reusability and scalability in mind, Higher Order Components (HOCs) are used. Enjoy custom color and file support, and experience image generation through DALLE AI. Create your own t-shirt model and download the result.

This project ensures responsiveness across all devices and optimizes site performance.

Let's dive into the exciting world of 3D web development together! ðŸš€
